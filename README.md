Día de los Muertos is a Bitsy game created by me using [Adam Le Doux](https://twitter.com/adamledoux)'s [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy). This game was built for [Pixel Picnic](https://www.facebook.com/pixelpicnic/)'s 2019 Bitsy Game Jam. 

Pixel Picnic is a local group based in Madison, Wisconsin that organizes meetings, socials and game jams for folks with diverse genders who are interested in all areas of Game Development.

## About
Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a cultural Mexican holiday celebrated in Mexico. The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to remember their loved ones whom have passed away, and help support their spiritual journey. We do not view it as a day of sadness, but rather a celebration because our loved ones are awake to celebrate with us.

It is tradition to build an Ofrenda (Altar) for your loved ones that includes pictures of the deceased, their favorite foods, drinks, flowers, and anything that they loved when they were alive. Another tradition is to paint your face as a calavera (skull) and dress as a catrina (skeleton), as a representation of life and death being together in one place.

### Gameplay
Your goal is to journey through the cemetary following the Aztec Marigolds leading you to your alter. In order to complete the Altar you will need to pick up a few items along the way to make it complete.
